-- #1
-- The example uses a WHERE clause to show the population of 'France'. Note that strings (pieces of text that are data) should be in 'single quotes';
-- Modify it to show the population of Germany
SELECT population FROM world
WHERE name = 'Germany'

-- #2
-- Checking a list The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list. The example shows the name and population for the countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India' and 'China'.
-- Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.
SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');

-- #3
-- Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). 
-- The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. 
-- Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000.

-- From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.

-- SELECT * FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
-- The FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table. 
-- The ON says how to figure out which rows in game go with which rows in goal - the matchid from goal must match id from game. 
-- (If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say ON (game.id=goal.matchid)
-- The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.
